### Step 4: Update Your Validator with the Keybase ID and Showcase Your Logo (Command Example)

Now that you have your Keybase ID, it's time to integrate it with your validator profile. The following command example utilizes the `mantrachaind` validator node, but the basic structure can be adapted for other chains.

**Remember:** Replace the bracketed placeholders with your specific information.

```
mantrachaind tx staking create-validator \
--amount=1000000uom \
--pubkey=$(mantrachaind tendermint show-validator) \
--moniker=$MANTRA_NODENAME \
--chain-id=$MANTRA_CHAIN_ID \
--commission-rate=0.10 \
--commission-max-rate=0.20 \
--commission-max-change-rate=0.05 \
--min-self-delegation="1" \
--gas-prices=0.002uom \
--gas-adjustment=1.5 \
--gas=auto \
--from=$MANTRA_WALLET \
--details="Always forward with the Anatolian Team ðŸš€" \
--security-contact="xxxxxxx@gmail.com" \
--website="https://anatolianteam.com" \
--identity="XXXX1111XXXX1111" \
--yes
```
